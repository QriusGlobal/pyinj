# Contributing

We follow trunk-based development and Conventional Commits. See the full guide in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Key points:

- Short-lived branches, PRs into `main`, squash merge.
- CI must pass (ruff, basedpyright, pytest).
- Releases automated by Release Please and published to PyPI via GitHub Releases.
