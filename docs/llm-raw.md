# LLM Raw Markdown Access

For LLM tools and agents that need direct access to PyInj documentation as raw markdown without HTML processing, use this direct GitHub raw content link:

**Raw Markdown URL:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QriusGlobal/pyinj/main/docs/llm.md
```

This endpoint provides:
- Pure markdown content without HTML wrapper
- No CSS or JavaScript processing  
- Direct HTTP GET access for LLM consumption
- Content-Type: text/plain
- Concise PyInj integration guide (<10k tokens)

# LLM Guide: Using PyInj for Reliable DI

Purpose: concise guidance for integrating PyInj into LLM-driven projects and tools.

- Audience: engineers wiring DI into agents, tools, plugins.
- Constraints: brief, <10k tokens, actionable.

## Core Concepts

- Token[T]: typed identifier for a dependency; holds name, type, scope.
- Scopes: SINGLETON (process), SESSION (user/session), REQUEST (per-call), TRANSIENT.
- Resolution: `get/aget` by token or type; `@inject` for functions.
- Registrations are immutable: re-registering a token raises.

## Setup (Minimal Boilerplate)

```python
from pyinj import Container, Token, Scope
container = Container()

# Tokens
HTTP = Token[HttpClient]("http", scope=Scope.SINGLETON)
TOOLRUN = Token[dict]("toolrun", scope=Scope.REQUEST)

# Providers
container.register(TOOLRUN, lambda: {"invocations": 0})

# Context-managed async singleton
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
@asynccontextmanager
async def http_cm():
    client = HttpClient()
    try:
        yield client
    finally:
        await client.aclose()

container.register_context_async(HTTP, lambda: http_cm())
```

## Per-Call Isolation (Agents/Tools)

```python
async def run_tool(container: Container, tool_input: dict) -> dict:
    async with container.async_request_scope():
        # REQUEST-scoped values
        state = container.get(TOOLRUN)
        state["invocations"] += 1
        http = await container.aget(HTTP)
        return await http.post("/run", json=tool_input)
```

## Injection in Handlers

```python
from pyinj.injection import Inject, inject

@inject(container=container)
async def handler(payload: dict, http: Inject[HttpClient]):
    return await http.post("/endpoint", json=payload)
```

## Overrides (Per-Call or Test)

```python
FAKEHTTP = Token("http", HttpClient)
with container.use_overrides({FAKEHTTP: FakeHttpClient()}):
    # only this concurrent context sees the override
    ...
```

## Accepted Patterns

- Use `register_context_async/sync` for resources with lifecycles.
- Use `async_request_scope/request_scope` to delimit per-call lifetimes.
- Use `@inject` for handler entry points; avoid sprinkling `get()` across code.
- Prefer tokens per logical dependency; avoid string-based tokens.
- Use `override()`/`use_overrides()` in tests or local contexts.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- Re-registering tokens at runtime (immutable; raises).
- Storing global singletons in module-level variables—use SINGLETON scope instead.
- Long-lived REQUEST/SESSION scopes—close them promptly.
- Mixing sync-only cleanup for async resources—use async cleanup and `aclose()`.
- Hidden side-effects in providers—keep providers pure and fast.

## Breaking Patterns (Incorrect)

- Registering async providers via `register` and resolving with `get()` — use `aget()` or `register_context_async`.
- Entering async-only resources with sync cleanup (e.g., using `with container:` for async singletons) — this raises an error; use `await container.aclose()`.
- Accessing request-scoped values outside of any request/session scope — value won't exist.

## Failure Modes & Diagnostics

- Circular dependencies: descriptive error with resolution chain.
- Provider setup failure: exception propagates (fail-fast); inspect the original error.
- Missing registration: `ResolutionError` with guidance.

## Migration Notes

- Registrations are now immutable; remove any re-registration logic.
- Switch resource cleanup to `register_context_sync/async`.

## Checklist for LLM Integrations

- [ ] Define tokens per tool/client/config.
- [ ] Register context-managed singletons for IO clients.
- [ ] Wrap each tool/agent invocation in a request scope.
- [ ] Use `@inject` for handler entry points.
- [ ] Add overrides for tests and per-call variations.
- [ ] Ensure async cleanup is awaited in shutdown paths.
